# This program will take a list of N number of elements.
# The list will hold all of the elements from 1 to N in no particular order.
# One number will be missing and it is up to the program to determine the missing number.
# For example, N = 5 input: [1, 2, 5, 4], output: 3
# HINT: N is the highest index + 1.
