# Question: Implement a function called word_count that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary 
# where the keys are unique words in the string and the values are the frequencies of those words. 
# Assume that words are separated by spaces and that capitalization should be ignored.

# For example:

# Input: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
# Output: {'the': 2, 'quick': 1, 'brown': 1, 'fox': 1, 'jumps': 1, 'over': 1, 'lazy': 1, 'dog.': 1}
